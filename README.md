# 100 days of code with python #

## Day 1: Hello, World! ##
    - print "Hello, World" to the screen usint the print() function

## Day 2: Variables ##
### Create the following variables of different types and print them ###
    - name: String
    - age: Integer
    - height: Floating-point number
    - is_student: Boolean
    - email: None (representing a null value)
    - siblings: List
    - address: Dictionary containing street and city

## Day 3: Input and Output ##
### Basic Input and Output: ###
    Write a program that reads a single input from the user and prints it to the console. For example, if the user enters their name, the program should output: ""Hello, {name}""

### Handling Different Data Types: ###
    Extend the program to read and print different types of inputs. Ensure the inputs are properly converted to their respective types and then printed. The program should ask the user to enter:
    - A string
    - An integer
    - A floating-point number

## Day 4: Basic Operators and Expressions ###
### Arithmetic Operators ###
Write a program to perform the following arithmetic operations using two numbers:
    - Addition (+)
    - Subtraction (-)
    - Multiplication (*)
    - Division (/)
    - Floor Division (//)
    - Modulus (%)
    - Exponentiation (**)

### Relational Operators ###
Write a program to compare two numbers using the following operators:
    - Equal to (==)
    - Not equal to (!=)
    - Greater than (>)
    - Less than (<)
    - Greater than or equal to (>=)
    - Less than or equal to (<=)

### Logical Operators ###
Write a program that evaluates the following between 2 booleans(True or False):
    - Logical AND (and)
    - Logical OR (or)
    - Logical NOT (not)

## Day 5: Conditional Statements and Loops ##
### If-else Statements ###
    - Write a program that takes an integer as input and checks if it's even or odd.
    - Write a program that takes an age as input and determines if the person is a child, teenager, adult, or senior citizen.

### Nested If-else Statements ###
    - Using nested if-else, write a program that takes three numbers as input and determines the largest among them.

### For Loop ###
    - Write a program to calculate the sum of all numbers up to the given input number.

### While Loop ###
    - Write a program to calculate the factorial of a given number.

## Day 6: Functions and Code Reusability ##
### Simple Function ### 
     - Define and call a simple function greet_user which takes name as a parameter. The function should print 'Hello, name' to the console.

### Default and Keyword Arguments ###
    - Update the greet_user function by adding a default value 'Guest' for the name parameter. When the function is called without an argument it should print 'Hello, Guest' to the console.

### Function with Return Values ###
    - Write a function that calculates and returns the area of a rectangle. The function should take length and breadth as the arguments.

## Day 7: Lists and Tuples ##
### Lists ###
    -   Create a list of 5 elements
    -   Use both positive and negative indices to retrieve items from the list.
    -   Append, insert, remove, or update elements using built-in methods.
    -   Use slicing to create sublists by selecting a specific range of elements.
    -   Iterate Through the List: Use loops (like for or while) to go through each item and perform operations on them.
### Tuples ###
    -   Define a tuple containing different types of data, such as strings, numbers, or booleans.
    -   Retrieve elements using index positions.
    -   Perform operations like concatenation (+) and repetition (*), or check membership with in.
    -   convert tuple into a list, make the changes, and convert it back if needed.

## Day 8: Sets and Dictionary ##
### Sets ###
    -   Define a set with multiple elements, including duplicates, and observe how duplicates are automatically removed.
    -   Add and Remove Items: Use add() to insert elements and remove() or discard() to delete them.
    -   Set Operations: perform mathematical set operations like union(), intersection(), and difference().
    -   Loop Through a Set: Use a loop to iterate over the elements in a set.

### Dictionaries ###
    -   Define a dictionary with keys and corresponding values.
    -   Access Values: Use a key to retrieve the associated value using square brackets or the get() method.
    -   Update and Add Items: Modify existing key-value pairs or add new ones.
    -   Remove Items: Use methods like pop() or del to remove entries from the dictionary.
    -   Loop Through a Dictionary: Iterate through keys, values, or both using a for loop with .items(), .keys(), or .  values().

## Day 9: Random number generator ##
    -   Write a program that generates a random number.
    -   Write a program that generates random number between 2 integers.

## Day 10: For-loop ##
    -   Use a for loop to print numbers from 1 to 10

## Day 11: While-loop ##
    -   Use a while loop to print even numbers from 2 to  20

## Day 12: Odd-even ##
    -   Write a program to check if a number is even or odd.

## Day 13: Largest of three numbers ###
    -   A program that finds the largest of three numbers

## Day 14:  Leap Year ##
    -   Write a program that checks if a given input year is a leap year or not

## Day 15: Factorial ##
    -   Write a function to calculate the factorial of a number.

## Day 16: Palindrome String ##
    -   A function to check if a given string is a palindrome.

## Day 17: Number of vowels in a string ##
    -   A function to count the number of vowels in a string.
