# 100 days of code with python #

## Day 1: Hello, World! ##
    - print "Hello, World" to the screen usint the print() function

## Day 2: Variables ##
### Create the following variables of different types and print them ###
    - name: String
    - age: Integer
    - height: Floating-point number
    - is_student: Boolean
    - email: None (representing a null value)
    - siblings: List
    - address: Dictionary containing street and city

## Day 3: Input and Output ##
### Basic Input and Output: ###
    Write a program that reads a single input from the user and prints it to the console. For example, if the user enters their name, the program should output: ""Hello, {name}""

### Handling Different Data Types: ###
    Extend the program to read and print different types of inputs. Ensure the inputs are properly converted to their respective types and then printed. The program should ask the user to enter:
    - A string
    - An integer
    - A floating-point number

## Day 4: Basic Operators and Expressions ###
### Arithmetic Operators ###
Write a program to perform the following arithmetic operations using two numbers:
    - Addition (+)
    - Subtraction (-)
    - Multiplication (*)
    - Division (/)
    - Floor Division (//)
    - Modulus (%)
    - Exponentiation (**)

### Relational Operators ###
Write a program to compare two numbers using the following operators:
    - Equal to (==)
    - Not equal to (!=)
    - Greater than (>)
    - Less than (<)
    - Greater than or equal to (>=)
    - Less than or equal to (<=)

### Logical Operators ###
Write a program that evaluates the following between 2 booleans(True or False):
    - Logical AND (and)
    - Logical OR (or)
    - Logical NOT (not)

## Day 5: Conditional Statements and Loops ##
### If-else Statements ###
    - Write a program that takes an integer as input and checks if it's even or odd.
    - Write a program that takes an age as input and determines if the person is a child, teenager, adult, or senior citizen.

### Nested If-else Statements ###
    - Using nested if-else, write a program that takes three numbers as input and determines the largest among them.

### For Loop ###
    - Write a program to calculate the sum of all numbers up to the given input number.

### While Loop ###
    - Write a program to calculate the factorial of a given number.
